<h1>My DSP Lab Project</h1>
<p>In this Project i have developed a ML Model that can predict weather a particular bank is bankrupted or not with 97% Accuracy</p>
<h1>Final Conclusions of our dataset</h1>
Concluding Analysis Of Company Bankruptcy Prediction Dataset :<br>
• This analysis successfully addressed the problem of predicting company bankruptcy
using a machine learning model.<br>
• We had applyed different ML models on our Dataset, And we choose Support Vector
Classification (SVC),<br>
• At first SVC model given higher Accuracy of 96.58%.<br>
• After using RandomSearchCV to Enhance our Model its Accuracy increased to 97.02%
because of best fit hyper perameters.<br>
• However, it’s important to acknowledge the data imbalance within the dataset. There
were significantly more non-bankrupted companies compared to bankrupted ones.<br>
• This imbalance can lead to overfitting the model to the majority class.<br>
• Now, our model is a good fit for the Bankruptcy Dataset.And this analysis make
good predictions on unseen data.<br>
• PCA is also capable to Enhance the Performance Of Our Model,And PCA also decrease the size of Dataset By Reducing The Number Of Features.PCA make it easy to visualize the Dataset.<br>
• Atlast , Problem Statement Of Predicting The Bankruptcy Status of a given sample
is Accomplished.
